<br><br>
Requirements:<br>
- python<br>
- opencv<br>
<br>
!Note:<br>
From my sample data of 1,847 images, it extracted a total of 1,570 images, only 886 of which has actual faces.<br>
Busy images might extract undesirable parts, such as background, objects and body parts that is not the whole face.<br>
