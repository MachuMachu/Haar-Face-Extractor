Sample input:<br>

<br>Sample output:<br>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82570638/129541891-5d7399b9-1323-45a9-a79e-b785ed7537ed.png" width=200 height=200>

!Note:<br>
From my sample data of 1,847 images, it extracted a total of 1,570 images, only 886 of which has actual faces.<br>
Busy images might extract undesirable parts, such as background, objects and body parts that is not the whole face.<br>
